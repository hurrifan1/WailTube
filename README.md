# WailTube

This is a Wails app that provides a GUI for the youtube-dl project.

Early stages right now but hoping to clean this up a lot soon. As you can probably tell, I didn't do much to change the aesthetics of the starter Wails template...I'm shameless, man.

## Todo

- [ ] Add full code annotations.
- [ ] Finish adding the proper animations.

## Structure

The structure follows the one recommended in the Wails documentation. The important Go code is in the app.go file and all of the GUI stuff is of course in the frontend folder.
